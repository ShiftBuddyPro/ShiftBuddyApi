      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
      <p>
        It is ShiftBuddyPro's policy to respect your privacy regarding any
        information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy
        Policy applies to{" "}
        <a style={{ color: "blue" }} href="https://www.shiftbuddypro.com">
          https://www.shiftbuddypro.com
        </a>{" "}
        (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://www.shiftbuddypro.com") as well as
        the mobile application ShiftBuddyPro. We respect your privacy and are
        committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may
        provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy
        ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our
        Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we
        may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy
        applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not
        apply to our collection of information from other sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on
        our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use
        of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website,
        you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
      </p>
      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>
        Like most website operators, ShiftBuddyPro collects
        non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
        servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
        preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
        request. ShiftBuddyPro's purpose in collecting non-personally
        identifying information is to better understand how ShiftBuddyPro's
        visitors use its website. From time to time, ShiftBuddyPro may release
        non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
        publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
      </p>
      <p>
        ShiftBuddyPro also collects potentially personally-identifying
        information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users
        and for users leaving comments on https://www.shiftbuddypro.com blog
        posts. ShiftBuddyPro only discloses logged in user and commenter IP
        addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
        personally-identifying information as described below.
      </p>
      <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>
        Certain visitors to ShiftBuddyPro's websites choose to interact with
        ShiftBuddyPro in ways that require ShiftBuddyPro to gather
        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
        that ShiftBuddyPro gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For
        example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
        https://www.shiftbuddypro.com to provide a username and email address.
      </p>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
        remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
        electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
        acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>
      <h2>Advertisements</h2>
      <p>
        Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising
        partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to
        recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement
        to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This
        information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted
        advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This
        Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by ShiftBuddyPro and does not
        cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
      </p>
      <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
      <p>
        Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by
        us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that
        third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy
        and terms and conditions of every site you visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content,
        privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or
        services.
      </p>
      <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>
        ShiftBuddyPro discloses potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
        contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
        information in order to process it on ShiftBuddyPro's behalf or to
        provide services available at ShiftBuddyPro's website, and (ii) that
        have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
        contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your
        home country; by using ShiftBuddyPro's website, you consent to the
        transfer of such information to them. ShiftBuddyPro will not rent or
        sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
        information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and
        affiliated organizations, as described above, ShiftBuddyPro discloses
        potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
        information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other
        governmental request, or when ShiftBuddyPro believes in good faith that
        disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
        ShiftBuddyPro, third parties or the public at large.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a registered user of https://www.shiftbuddypro.com and have
        supplied your email address, ShiftBuddyPro may occasionally send you an
        email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just
        keep you up to date with what's going on with ShiftBuddyPro and our
        products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of
        information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If
        you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our
        feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to
        help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other
        users. ShiftBuddyPro takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect
        against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of
        potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
        information.
      </p>
      <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
      <p>
        ShiftBuddyPro may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to
        its website. ShiftBuddyPro may display this information publicly or
        provide it to others. However, ShiftBuddyPro does not disclose your
        personally-identifying information.
      </p>
      <h2>E-commerce</h2>
      <p>
        Those who engage in transactions with ShiftBuddyPro – by purchasing
        ShiftBuddyPro's services or products, are asked to provide additional
        information, including as necessary the personal and financial
        information required to process those transactions. In each case,
        ShiftBuddyPro collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
        appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
        ShiftBuddyPro. ShiftBuddyPro does not disclose personally-identifying
        information other than as described below. And visitors can always
        refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat
        that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
        activities.
      </p>
      <h2>Business Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        If ShiftBuddyPro, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or
        in the unlikely event that ShiftBuddyPro goes out of business or enters
        bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
        transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
        transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of ShiftBuddyPro may continue
        to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
      </p>
      <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
      <p>
        Although most changes are likely to be minor, ShiftBuddyPro may change
        its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in ShiftBuddyPro's sole
        discretion. ShiftBuddyPro encourages visitors to frequently check this
        page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this
        site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your
        acceptance of such change.
